This is a (for now just a) engine written in C

it uses SDL for input/output but nothing else ... everything is written in Software ... not OpenGL, no Vulkan, no DirectX

for now it only runs under Linux (i use kubuntu 24.04 LTS)

HOW TU RUN:
- clone everything
- go to the latest folder (each folder is one version)
- run "make clean && make && ./ets3"
